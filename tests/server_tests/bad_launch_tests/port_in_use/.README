Somehow port_in_use test will produce a difference in .out and the actual out

DIFF:
1,2c1
< INVALID
< CONFIGURATION
---
> INVALID CONFIGURATION

From observation this seems to be a problem caused by catching stdout from the
running server and the error msg from the new server trying to launch using the same port.
Yet the latency between them (or not that) is somehow causing this random new line output.

This won't really affect much in terms of branch coverage.
So I still manage to put this in as the test itself is working perfectly fine?

THIS AMAZINGLY WORKS PERFECTLY ON ED, solved
