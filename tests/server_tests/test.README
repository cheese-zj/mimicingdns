Some specific test problems are stated in README file in specific tests
: bad_launch_tests/port_in_use

3 parts of testing:
    bad_launch_tests : cases of server.py won't be launched correctly
    buffer_tests : multiple .in files to test buffer
    msg_tests : test all the basic functions of server.py

abandon_files... I kept them there but nothing's executed, including informal tests and samples for inspection reasons.
